                        The <strong>Wendler 5/3/1 Program</strong> is a strength training regimen designed by Jim Wendler. It's a simple, effective, and flexible program aimed at increasing your one-rep max (1RM) in key lifts over time. The program focuses on four main compound lifts: Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, and Overhead Press.

                        <li><strong>4-Week Cycle:</strong> Each cycle consists of three training weeks followed by a deload week.</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Overload:</strong> Gradually increasing the weights to build strength.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rep Scheme:</strong> The numbers 5, 3, and 1 refer to the reps performed at different percentages of your 1RM.</li>
                    </ul>

                        The "+" sign indicates that you should perform as many reps as possible (AMRAP) while maintaining good form. After completing each 4-week cycle, you increase your training max (usually 5-10 lbs) and start the next cycle, ensuring continuous progress.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Key Principles</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Focuses on a few core lifts without excessive volume.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Regularly following the cycle for long-term gains.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Can be tailored to individual needs and schedules.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        By adhering to the Wendler 5/3/1 Program, you can systematically build strength, prevent plateaus, and achieve significant improvements in your main lifts.
